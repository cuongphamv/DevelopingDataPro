## Sample size calculation

Calculating the sample size for a simple random sample of a proportion is a crucial step in designing statistically valid surveys or experiments.

This Shiny app is designed to streamline the process of determining sample sizes for proportions in statistical studies



## Sample size fomular

\[
n = \frac{z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}{E^2}
\]

where:

- \( n \) is the sample size.
- \( z \) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.
- \( p \) is the estimated proportion.
- \( E \) is the margin of error.


## How to use

Change the Proportion*(p)*, Marginal Error*(e)* and Confidence level *(cl)* then press Calculate for your **sample size**
